# ThrottleHeat - A 2D Delivery Simulator

**ThrottleHeat** is a 2D delivery simulation game inspired by the classic *Euro Truck Simulator 2* but reimagined in a modern and lightweight format. This project focuses on delivering a fun and interactive experience while showcasing real-world delivery challenges in a stylized, arcade-like environment. Built with a modern web stack and a Python backend, the game bridges immersive gameplay with solid architecture.

##  Game Concept

You play as a delivery driver navigating through a retro-styled 2D city. Your job is to:
- Pick up packages from warehouses
- Deliver them to destinations on time
- Manage your fuel, vehicle wear, and traffic
- Upgrade your vehicle for better efficiency and speed

Unlike complex simulators, **ThrottleHeat** focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and aesthetic charm while still offering strategic gameplay.

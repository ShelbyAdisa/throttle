## 🕹️ Game Concept

You play as a delivery driver navigating through a retro-styled 2D city. Your job is to:
- Pick up packages from warehouses
- Deliver them to destinations on time
- Manage your fuel, vehicle wear, and traffic
- Upgrade your vehicle for better efficiency and speed

Unlike complex simulators, **ThrottleHeat** focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and aesthetic charm while still offering strategic gameplay.
